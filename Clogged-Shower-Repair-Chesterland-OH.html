<p>Garbage disposals are designed to work in one of two ways. Either through what's known as a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered before it is switched on, or through a continuous feed, where the system can be filled while it is running. An approved backflow prevention device, which should be tested annually, need to be set up on the service connection that the department has actually recognized as having a potential for backflow.
