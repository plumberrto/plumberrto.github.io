<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is suggested to check the manufacturer's directions for special preventative measures.</p>
<p>Difficult water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can prevent a flush valve from closing completely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the particles. Images 1 and 2 show you how to do this on one common type of valve. Despite the fact that other valves will look various, the clearing process is similar. Nevertheless, you may have to get rid of a few screws on top of the fill valve to eliminate the cap.</p>
