Always continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
