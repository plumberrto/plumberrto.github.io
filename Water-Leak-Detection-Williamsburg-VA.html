<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the potable supply of water and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An approved, appropriately installed and maintained backflow assembly essentially eliminates the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a much shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability.

This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical areas in the assembly.
