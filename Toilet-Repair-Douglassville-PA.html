<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Douglassville PA</h3>

A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater. To make sure that we are supplying top quality work and client peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely perform water heater replacements.
