<p>Some producers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Minnesota has a growing issue with chloride in water. Chloride in water threatens our fresh-water fish and other water life.

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 indications of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up with time, they slowly start to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you notice it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>
