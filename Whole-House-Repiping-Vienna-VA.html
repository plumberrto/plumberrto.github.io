<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>It's an excellent idea to check your backflow assembly every spring when you turn your irrigation system on. However, we seldom advise CPVC when an entire house needs repiping. The pipes can end up being breakable, over time, and might require replacement sooner than hoped. Some states need pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they might likewise need an unique license to deal with gas lines. Licensing typically needs an examination or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for additional information.</p>
