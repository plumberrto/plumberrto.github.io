<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily stored for later use when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
