Due to the fact that the tank or the entire toilet should be raised off the floor for a proper repair, either of these leaks can be hard to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a a lot more pricey repair. Ryan's Plumbing has thoroughly trained personnel who will treat your toilet and home with the utmost care.</p>
<p>If you find a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping job, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the same product and they might be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
