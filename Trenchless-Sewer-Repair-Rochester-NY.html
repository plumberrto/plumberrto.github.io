<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
