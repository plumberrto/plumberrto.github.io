<p>Have a look at the water heater repair and installation services we provide.

The CareSoft ® system was established with the same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite designs, with resin that provides high-performance hardness elimination you can rely on for many years to come. It's pretty typical for debris to end up being flushed down our drains. Think of how often food particles, cooking oil and hair winds up in our showers and sinks. After adequate time, these products might build up into clogs, which can obstruct the circulation of water throughout a house. This can result in several problems, from foul stinks to water leakages and burst pipes.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully restored.</p>
