If not, Apollo Home's licensed and qualified plumbers will do what it takes to get your garbage disposal grinding away again or install a new one, typically on the same day.

For each device, the cost can vary from a base of $7,500 to $15,000 for midsize buildings and $15,000 to $35,000 for bigger buildings; this does not include the PE's or RA's style charges. The DEP filing fee is $350 per service connection and the DOB filing charge is a little over 1% of the estimated plumbing cost. The size of the device is also a factor in cost. For example, a one-inch device can begin at $225, while a three-inch device might cost $2,800. Labor costs likewise increase with pipe size.</p>

Scalding water is generally the result of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and must be immediately dealt with by an experienced plumbing professional.</p>
