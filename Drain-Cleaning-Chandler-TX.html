<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water flow, takes place. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to leave. Often no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
