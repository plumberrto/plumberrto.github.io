Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things differently might have saved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

Bear in mind that pipes do not have a "busy season," they see regular use all year. Schedule service today and begin keeping a record of their maintenance history if you can't remember the last time you had your pipes looked at.</p>

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two indications of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect gradually, they gradually begin to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to occur, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
