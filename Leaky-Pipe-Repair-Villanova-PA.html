<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
