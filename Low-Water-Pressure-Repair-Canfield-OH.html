<p>When the flush valve in the tank stops working or wears out, another bothersome problem is. If you hear the toilet running continuously or periodically you probably need the valve or float replaced.  Stopping working to repair a running toilet can lead to wasted water and a really high water expense. Water in Florida is expensive so don't postpone-- get a running toilet repaired. Repairing it might be best if your water heater is just a couple of years old and just has a minor issue. If the cost of replacing damaged parts is affordable, you might want to think about fixing your water heater and scheduling regular maintenance.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent to drain. This procedure continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
