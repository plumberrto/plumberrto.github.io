Harts is a terrific local company to work with. How will you deal with a serious clog after it blocks a chemical drain cleaner? Blocked cleaner can develop a harmful swimming pool in your sink, making any new attempt to clear it more harmful. If your disposal's installation will require a new installing flange in the sink, you'll need to install that first. If you're changing an old disposer, remove it as discussed above.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, make sure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>
