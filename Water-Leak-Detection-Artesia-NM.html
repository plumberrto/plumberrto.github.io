<p>To assist avoid blockages within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the approach laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee. This is specifically real when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
