<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might occur.
