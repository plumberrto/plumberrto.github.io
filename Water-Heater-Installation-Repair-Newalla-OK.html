They use a variety of parts and gadgets that collaborate for the functionality of a single sink. For instance, a kitchen sink may include as many as 6 separate systems just to provide the total service we expect. Like any machine, a sink has numerous parts that need repair and maintenance over time. A plumbing authorization offers 3 inspections. Additional inspections are $50.00 each.
