<p>Regrettably, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it typically becomes corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time.

Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas hot water heater with special venting systems likewise are offered. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
