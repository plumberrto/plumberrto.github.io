<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the magnificence in the toilet world, however the trip lever is the bridge in between man and machine. After all, if the trip lever does not raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to jerk and wiggle and sometimes even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper by hand. And who wishes to do all that work???

<p>Backflow preventers should only be fixed when the data collected from the field test shows the assembly has degraded in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic.

The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
