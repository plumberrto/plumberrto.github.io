<p>Regrow your softener with potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is readily available at most stores that sell softener salt.

When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
