<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water circulation, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to get away. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly.
