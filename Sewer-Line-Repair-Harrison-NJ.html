Something as trivial as moving a gas clothing dryer for any function whatsoever can harm the gas pipe. Gas lines which are versatile are vulnerable to crimping and leaking, others made from inappropriate, low-grade product likewise end up being breakable rapidly and rust away, triggering an extreme leak.

To prevent such an event, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention method made use of. The very best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture).
