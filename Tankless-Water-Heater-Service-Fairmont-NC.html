<p>Lubrication might aid with the placement of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the specialist assemble the elements into the body without developing damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lubricant to ensure the water system is not infected. In most cases the best lubricant is water. The normal usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be gently lubed to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to use or stop working out sooner by attracting dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the part.

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
