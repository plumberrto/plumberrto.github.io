<p>Our process begins with an inspection of the various problems dealt with by the homeowner, this is followed by among our comprehensive group of specialists inserting a camera into the drains to recognize the blocked area and determine how best to proceed. In the past, a blocked drain suggested a snake would be used to pierce a hole in the drain to permit a small amount of wastewater to travel through the obstruction and keep the waste moving through the drain.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis.
