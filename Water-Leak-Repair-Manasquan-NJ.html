<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
