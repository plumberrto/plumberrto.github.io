<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
<p>Lots of house owners set up a yearly plumbing inspection to keep up with preventive maintenance and ensure that the home's plumbing remains in great working order.
