When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your house.

Salt is generally used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
