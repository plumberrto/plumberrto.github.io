Fast heating gas heaters, as a general rule, will heat water far much faster than an electric hot water heater of the very same standard measurements and capacity. An electric hot water heater may take a full hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater could heat up two times that amount in the same offered time and potentially quicker.</p>
