It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain in addition to avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really important here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
