<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
