<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outside. An RPZ will occasionally release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ ought to be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Remove the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water.

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
