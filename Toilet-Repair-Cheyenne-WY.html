<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
