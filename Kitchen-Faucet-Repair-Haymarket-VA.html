<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the approach set out above. Since the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
