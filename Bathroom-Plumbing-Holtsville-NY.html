<p>In community supply of water systems, water is generally kept at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or company. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may take place when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance happens, infected water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an incident, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach utilized. The very best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air gap is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>

It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>For a cutoff switch where the backflow preventer lies upstream of the booster pump( s) - set at 10 psi.
