<p>Do you notice that you have flaky or dry skin, or does your water have a chemical or rotten egg odor? It probably goes without stating that leaking pipes need to be replaced instantly. It might be normal to have condensation on hot water pipes, but it's definitely not typical for your pipes to spring a leak. A waste disposal unit can reduce a home's total garbage output by pulverizing most typical food scraps so they can be removed through the sink as wastewater. A garbage disposal fits virtually seamlessly into the sink, and can be maintained by just getting rid of a couple of ice and some baking soda once a month to sharpen the blades and lower unpleasant smells.</p>
<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and rotate the big, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
