<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it challenging to gain access to in-wall pipes, consider at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, changing exposed pipes in a energy, crawlspace, or basement room is relatively simple, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
