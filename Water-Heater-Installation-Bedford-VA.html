<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system as the outcome of the downstream pressure being greater than the supply pressure. This reduction in supply pressure happens whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied (such as during water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water pipe). Garbage disposal warranties last approximately 5 years, but they can range in between 2 and 10 years. Since the typical life expectancy of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may wish to purchase an extended guarantee. Many service warranties cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To avoid further breakdowns, house owners need to stay up to date with routine maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>

Let it sit for a few minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mixture. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water appliances? This is a great sign that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be replaced. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water only features hot water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
