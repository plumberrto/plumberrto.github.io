<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs.
