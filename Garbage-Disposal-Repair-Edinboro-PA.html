<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk contains the oldest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had changeable and easily detachable segments, and enabled cleaning.</p>
<p>The double check assembly was developed in the 1950s for the fire defense industry, developing a redundancy designed to guarantee that one check valve will continue to secure the city water supply even if the other fails. This assembly likewise makes it possible for the closure of one valve to minimize the pressure differential throughout the other, creating a more reliable seal and preventing even small backflow leak. Test dicks, or small ball valves, make it possible for the attachment of testing devices that assesses whether the double check assembly is functional.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation of water which might bring unclean water or other, dangerous substances into the general public supply of water and private plumbing. Backflow can happen in a variety of circumstances that may draw water from places such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
