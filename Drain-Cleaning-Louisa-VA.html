In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.
