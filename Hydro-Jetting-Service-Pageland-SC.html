Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
