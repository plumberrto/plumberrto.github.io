If you see low water pressure or blemished water, it usually represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure.

While this may operate in the short-term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the very same product as other pipes in your house, meaning that problem might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>
