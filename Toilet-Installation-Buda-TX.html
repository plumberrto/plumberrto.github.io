<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to leave. In some cases no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>

After mounting the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
