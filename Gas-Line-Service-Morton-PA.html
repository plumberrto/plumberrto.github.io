<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
