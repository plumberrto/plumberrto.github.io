<p>To assist prevent obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the method laid out above. Since the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
