<p>The waste disposal unit is an extremely practical function, however it's something that shouldn't be overlooked in regards to care and maintenance. Lots of people do not treat their waste disposal unit appropriately, which can lead to all sort of issues.

Age-- As we discussed, a 10+ year old hot water heater is probably on its last legs. If you are not exactly sure how old your system is, you should have the ability to get that information from the identification number on the maker's sticker (usually near the top of the unit). Usually, the first two numbers indicate the year of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Take a look at the water heater repair and installation services we offer. Our mission at Brennan Heating & Air Conditioning is to make certain that our Bellevue consumers have reliable hot water whenever they need it. The CareSoft Â® system was established with the very same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite designs, with resin that delivers high-performance hardness elimination you can count on for years to come. It's pretty typical for particles to wind up being flushed down our drains. Think about how frequently food particles, cooking oil and hair ends up in our showers and sinks. After adequate time, these products may develop into obstructions, which can obstruct the flow of water throughout a home. This can lead to a number of problems, from foul smells to water leaks and burst pipes.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close.
