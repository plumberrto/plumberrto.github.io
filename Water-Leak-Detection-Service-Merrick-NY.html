<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. A garbage disposal resolves all of those problems, adding convenience. Just turn on water at the garbage and the sink disposal does the rest - and much more silently than you think. By crushing food waste-- modern garbage disposals don't really use blades - it's processed by water treatment facilities where the small particulates are quickly strained and turned into solid fertilizer, which, in turn, can be sold to lower the total costs of treatment.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of disposals: batch feed and continuous feed. A lot of homes make use of continuous feed disposals, which means the disposal will work as long as it is switched on. When a lot of work is to be done in the kitchen, this is helpful. When the cover is closed, batch disposals have a holding tank that accumulates waste till it is complete and is then triggered. Our plumbers can help you decide which type of disposal will work best for your sink.</p>
