<p>Regenerate your softener with potassium chloride rather of salt chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is offered at many stores that sell softener salt. A single tank or cabinet-style system requires less area due to the fact that the softener's brine tank nests inside of the salt tank. Clogged blockage and drainage problems may begin as minor issues however can quickly speed up into significant issues. A clogged drain can even lead to slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and expensive repairs.</p>
<p>As hard water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, totally free" sodium ions are released into the water. Softer clothing without difficult minerals trapped in the material. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the dingy gray triggered by difficult water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, repairing, changing and servicing our softener. Appreciate the time and service you send our way. The replacement tank has actually repaired the issue we were having.</p>
