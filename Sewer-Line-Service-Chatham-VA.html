If pushing down on the flapper stops the sound, the flapper isn't sealing under typical pressure. Switch off the water, flush the toilet to empty the tank and after that run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat.

You need to replace the flapper if cleaning the flush valve seat doesn't solve the issue.</p>
