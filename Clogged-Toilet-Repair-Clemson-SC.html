<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Clemson SC</h3>
<p>Leakages can take place if the seal in between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain fails.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a procedure called ion exchange to remove tough water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process known as Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that won't stay with any surface in your house, keeping your appliances and warm water heaters free of tough water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners due to the fact that they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And because these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of recorded ions.</p>
