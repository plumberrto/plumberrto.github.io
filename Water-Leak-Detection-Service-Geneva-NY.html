We've already seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the difference in between them? When it pertains to the concern of hard water, a conventional water softener in fact eliminates silica, magnesium and calcium ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is referred to as temporary firmness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally sodium or often potassium).</p>
