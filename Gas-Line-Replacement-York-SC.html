<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly kept for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
