<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any leftover impurities.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
