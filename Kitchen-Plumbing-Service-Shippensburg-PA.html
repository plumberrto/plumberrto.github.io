How frequently a toilet clogs depends upon the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush.

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most home centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
