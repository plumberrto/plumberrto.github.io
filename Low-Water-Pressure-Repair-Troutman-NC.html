<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Troutman NC</h3>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
