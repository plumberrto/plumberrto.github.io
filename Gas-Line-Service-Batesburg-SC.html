<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Batesburg SC</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
