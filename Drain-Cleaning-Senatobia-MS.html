It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard versus back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
