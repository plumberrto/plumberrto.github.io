Assess the sewer lines from property to suppress connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to completely examine if pipe damage, rust, or major blockages are present. Tree roots are one of the greatest reasons for a sewer line backup. As roots enter into the drain line they can cause clogs and back up into your home.</p>

Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close.
