We focus on doing the job right and as merely as possible to avoid problems down the road.

The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
<p>The cost depends on the size of the house and the variety of bathrooms and plumbing components-- laundry room, wet bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your last costs. While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth procedure.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
