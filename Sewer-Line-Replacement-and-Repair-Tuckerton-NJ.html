<p>Close all exterior doors and windows and switch on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a close-by warm water faucet up until you hear the gas burner in the water heater ignite. After a minute, move a smoking cigarettes match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke ought to be drawn up the vent pipe.

<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
