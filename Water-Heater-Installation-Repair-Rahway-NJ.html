<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
